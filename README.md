What?
	Beats is a detailed review and feedback mechanism for doctors. And using collected patient records like location and blood group hospitals can do dynamic geo search for blood requirement.
  
Why?
	There is no proper review mechanisms for doctors and hospitals though google review is in place. Google just give you some stars and it wont tell detailed analysis like infrastructure doctor quality and waiting time etc.
	
How?
	Patients - Patients can enroll them selves with basic details and blood group and geographic location for geo processing. Patients can search through map for near by specialty doctors and book appoinment on the same. Patient can see detailed ratings for infrastructure, quality and waiting time. Once patient completes his visit, he can giev feed back.
	Doctors  - Doctors can view book appointments booked against them and view feedbacks given to him for the past week or a month based on a configuration.
	Hospitals- Hospitals can add a doctors and search for blood group near given location by doing geo search for patient locations.
